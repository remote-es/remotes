# Introduction

This is a repository listing companies which offer full-time remote jobs with
Spanish contracts

# Why

When considering a remote job, it's natural to think that you can work for any
company in the world. However, if you live in Spain, working for companies
abroad means becoming self-employed, which has several drawbacks:

* Your employer can end your contract at any time
* You need to do extra paperwork compared to a regular full-time job
* There is no clear legal framework. Apparently it is not OK to be self-employed
  and work for a single Spanish company. There seems to be no clear messaging
  from the government that doing the same for a foreign company is OK

There is a significant amount of resources to find a remote job, but we have
found none targetting people living in Spain. As we believe that the number of
companies allowing remote work in Spain are limited, a list seems a good
approach for those seeking a remote work; they can simply go through the list
and look for open positions.

# Conditions

## Remote

We will only list companies which allow working fully remotely (e.g. you can
work from anywhere in Spain and you do not have to set foot in an office if you
don't want to). Some occasional travelling for onboarding, team building or
similar purposes is fine. Also the companies must also hire people using
Spanish full-time contracts (i.e. not self-employment).

Please make a note in the offer if:

* You have work schedule requirements which deviate significantly from Spanish
  normal office hours
* You have specific travel requirements (monthly onsites, etc.) which happen
  more than 3 times a year
* You require language knowledge other than Spanish and/or medium English

or anything you feel might be important to users of the list, especially if
this is not clearly stated in the offers in your listings.

## Offers

Please provide a stable URL which lists all offers that meet the conditions
for being listed in this page (or a simple way to filter/locate them).

We recommend:

* Not using an URL or page that seems to be for a specific offer (e.g.
  `/blog/backend_python_dev`). People browsing the list might not feel
  confident that the offer is still available and up to date
* Showing clearly when offers were posted
* Highlight clearly which offers fulfill the criteria for this listing
  or that all offers do. For instance, indicate clearly which offers
  are remote, etc.

# Adding a company

If you are a company or an individual, send a PR which adds the company to the
list (in alphabetical order). Try to be brief to keep the list manageable.

# Support

It is our objective for this list to remain useful and effective for job
searchers. If you use this list and notice that a company listed below is no
longer useful (broken URL, not clearly listing remote offers which fulfill
the criteria for the listing, etc.), please send a PR removing it (along
with a justification) or open an issue.
